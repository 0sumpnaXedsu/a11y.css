This <abbr title="Cascading StyleSheet">CSS</abbr> file intends to warn developers about possible risks and mistakes that exist in HTML code. It can also be used to roughly evaluate a site's quality by simply including it as an external stylesheet.

Note that this bookmarklet might take a couple of seconds to load since it basically injects the `a11y.css` stylesheet within the DOM of the page you're browsing. It might be a bit slow at first because it is being downloaded from GitHub, but it's the price to pay to keep it <b>up-to-date</b>.
